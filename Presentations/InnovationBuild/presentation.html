# How to Convert Measured Signals to Useful Data?

- A small computer can be used to collect the data from all our sensors and convert them to useful information
 - For example, the computer can read the outputs from the voltage and current sensors and calculate important information like the remaining battery capacity or the drive power
- The output from most of our sensors are in analog form but the computer can only understand digital numbers
 - We need to convert the output from our sensors to digital numbers (i.e. 1s and 0s)
- A circuit is provided to you that has a voltage sensor, current sensor and a small computer
 - We named this the "EvoSens Board"
 - The small computer has built in circuitry to convert analog signals to digital numbers
- The "EvoSens Board" also has the ability to send information wirelessly using Bluetooth 
 - You can also connect other sensors like a tachometer or a brake sensor to the "EvoSens Board" using expansion pins provided

# How Can We Build a Circuit Quickly?

.left-column[
- We need a way to connect electronic components together to build a circuit
 - This is typically done by soldering the components on to a printed circuit board (PCB) similar to what is done on the "EvoSens Board"
- If you had to build a simple circuit quickly how will you do this?
 - Getting a PCB made takes time 
 - A breadboard can be used to help build a circuit quickly
- Component legs are inserted into holes in order to make connections with other components
 - Holes are electrically connected with other holes as indicated in the diagram

# Building an LED Circuit with On/Off Switch

- Lets build a circuit that lets us turn-on and turn-off an LED with a switch
 - When the switch is closed by pressing the knob we want the LED to light-up
- Assemble a push-button, an LED and a resistor on a breadboard to create this circuit
 - The resistor limits the current through the LED and therefore controls its brightness 
- Connect a 9V battery to power the circuit and make sure it works as expected
 - How can we make the LED brighter or can we add more LEDs?

# Building a Voltage Sensor Circuit

.left-column[
- Battery voltage is too high to be measured by a computer
 - Functionality of the voltage sensor is to step-down the battery voltage to a value that can be measured by the computer
- A voltage sensor can be made using two resistors that form a voltage divider
 - Voltage at the mid point of the divider is 
\\[\text {Mesurement} = \text {Battery Voltage} \times \frac {R\_{sens2}} {R\_{sens1} + R\_{sens2}} \\]
- Build a voltage sensor cricuit to measure the voltage of a 9V battery
 - Use two `\( 1k\Omega \)` resistors to step-down the voltage to 4.5V
 - With a multimeter confirm your circuit works

# Turning an LED On and Off with Arduino (P-I)

.left-column[
- In the circuit we built using a breadbaord a push-button was used to turn the LED on and off
 - Pushing the button supplyied 9V through a resistor to an LED turns it on
 - Releasing the button removed the 9V supply turns the LED off
- Can we use an Arduino microcontroller to automate this process?
 - When a digital pin is set to produce a logic high output it behaves like a turned-on switch and supplies 5V
 - When a digital pin is set to produce a logic low output it behaves like turned-off switch and supplies 0V
- Thus a digital pin can replace the push-button
 - Connect the anode of LED through a resistor to pin 6 
 - Connect the cathode to ground

# Turning an LED On and Off with Arduino (P-II)

.left-column2[
- In your program first 'setup' pin 6 as an output pin 
 - Pin 6 can now produce 5V (logic high) or 0V (logic low) similar to switch turning on or off
- We could also 'setup' a digital pin to read digital inputs
 - We will look at an example later
- To blink the LED, flip the digital pin between 5V and 0V every 1s
- 5V is produced by writing a logic high to the digital pin
 - Keep 5V on for 1s by 'delaying' 1s
- 0V is produced by writing a logic low to the digital pin
 - Keep 0V on for 1s by 'delaying' 1s
- Tell program to 'loop' indefinitely through this program

# Digital and Analog Signals

.left-column[
- Binary signals that correspond to a logic high (true) or logic low (false) are called digital signals
 - A logic high is (usually) 5V and a logic low is 0V
 - Digital signals are read using a digital pin on a microcontroller
 - Need to setup the pin as an 'input' pin
- Continuous voltage signals that change over time are called analog signals
 - A microcontroller reads the analogue siganls using specific analog pins, which are connected to an Analogue to Digital converter (ADC) of a microcontroller
- An ADC convert an analog signal to a digital number
 - Microcontrollers typically have built in ADCs
 - Higher ADC resolution improves accuracy

# Variables and Logic Statements 

.left-column2[
- Variables act as memory to store values, similar to math
- There are different variable types 
 - Integer, character, float, string, unsigned int, etc.
- Crucial to define the correct type of variable
 - Variables 'A' and 'B' that hold an integer number can be defined as *int A* and *int B*
 - 'A' can be assigned a value as `\( \text {A=2*B or A=10} \)`
- *if* and *else* statements can be used to make decisions
- Logic operators compare variables
 - Equal (A==B), not equal (A!=B)
 - Greater than `\( \text {(A > B)} \)`, Less than  `\( \text {(A < B)} \)`
 - AND (A&&B), OR (A||B)

# Detecting Push-Button Press with Arduino

.left-column2[
- Pressing or releasing a push-button generate a digital signal
 - When pressed it produce 5V, which is a logic High
 - When released it has 0V, which is a logic Low
- Note: some circuits may use reverse logic ('active low')
- Using the breadboard connect one end of push-button to 5V and the other end to pin 5
  - You may add a resistor and a capacitor from pin 5 to ground as a debouncer
- In your program first 'setup' pin 5 as a digital input pin     
- Loop indefinitely while monitoring the digital pin 5
  - Store input in an integer variable 'switchInput'
  - Output 'switchInput' to pin 6 connected to LED

# Toggling the LED with Button Press

.right-column2[
- Lets toggle an LED on or off at a push-button press
- Use an *if* statement to check if pin 6 attached to the button is logic-high
- If logic-high, then change the state of the LED
  - We need to set a *flag* to make sure LED is not toggled if button is kept pressed
  - We don't toggle the LED if the *flag* is high
- If logic-low, reset the *flag* if the button is released

- Microcontrollers communicate with other devices through many methods
 - Examples include USB, HDMI, Serial, CAN, etc.
- *Serial* provides a simple way to send/revieve messages
 - Send/receive a stream of logic-highs and lows over a wire 
- Most devices, communicates with the microcontroller using serial
 - Examples include PC/laptop, Bluetooth modules, screens, etc.
- Lets get the Arduino Nano to display your name on the PC screen
 - In your program, first 'setup' *Serial* communication at a speed of 9600 bps
 - In the loop, using *Print* function send your name to the PC every second
 - Use Arduino *Serial Monitor* to display message on the PC

- Lets use the "EvoSens Board" to measure the voltage of a 9V battery
 - In your real design this will be the 24V or the 48V vehicle battery
- Connect the 9V battery across the terminals labelled "Battery" (make sure the polarity is correct)
- The voltage sesnor on the "EvoSens Board" steps-down the battery voltage by 1/7.8
 - This is because `\( R_{sens1} = 68k\Omega \)` and `\( R_{sens2} = 10k\Omega \)`
- In your program, first 'setup' *Serial* communication at 9600 bps so we can display battery voltage on PC
- Output of the voltage sensor is connected to A0 pin
 - Read the voltage at A0 using *AnalogRead*
- *AnalogRead* converts a 0V to 5V signal at A0 to a number between 0 and 1023
 - To get the actual voltage we have to multiply the result by 5 and divide by 1023
 - We also have to multiply this number by 7.8 to get the actual battery voltage by reversing the step-down introduced by the voltage sensor
- Read and display the battery voltage on PC every 1s

# Bluetooth Communication with Phone (P-I)

-	Bluetooth modules can communicate with the Arduino Nano using serial
-	Since we already use the default serial to communicate with PC we have to use a software serial 
-	Fortunately, we are going to use an existing software called AltSoftSerial to help us
-	Go to Tools > Manage Libraries, find AltSoftSerial and install it so we can use it in our project
-	We can now setup AltSoftSerial communication at 9600 bps to communicate with the Bluetooth module  
 -	Connect the Bluetooth module to header pins labeled “P1” 
- Lets have a counter that counts up every second upto 10 and send this counter value to the phone
 - The phone will receive the counter value every second
 - Display the counter value also on the PC so we can *debug* our code 
-	On your phone, download a *BluetoothLE* app to view the message sent by the Arduino 
 - Once you pair the Bluetooth module with the phone via the BluetoothLE app, the blinking red light will stay on indicating successful pairing

# Measuring Current (P-I)

-	The Arduino can only read analogue voltages and therefore before we can measure the current it needs to be converted to a voltage
-	For this purpose, we are using an integrated circuit (IC) called “ACS730”, which measures the current flowing from the battery to the motor controller and convert this current to a voltage between 0V and 5V
 - The output of the ACS730 IC is connected to pin A1 of the Arduino Nano
-	The ACS730 IC produces 2.5V when the current is 0A
- The ACS730 IC produces 0.04V per each 1A flowing through it
 - For example, if the current flowing through it is 20A then the voltage produced by the ACS730 will be 3.3V (i.e. 2.5V + 0.04 x 20V)
-	Note that the ACS730 IC may not produce exactly 2.5V when current is 0A
 - We can measure this value on pin A2 of the Arduino Nano and use it in our calculations to improve the accuracy of the measurement
- Lets write a program to measure both the battery current and voltage and display on PC screen
