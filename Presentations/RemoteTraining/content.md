#### Blinking LED Example
### Turn an LED On and Off

- Supplying 5V through a resistor to an LED turns it on
  - Removing the supply turns it off
- Like the breadboard example, a switch can be used 
  - Connects/diconnects the supply to LED
- Can we use a microcontroller to automate this?

<img src="img/ledblink.gif" class="noborder" alt="Variables in C" height="200px"/>

________
#### Blinking LED Example
### Using a Digital Pin as a Switch

- Connect an LED through a resistor to digital pin 11
- A digital pin can be set to produce a logic high output 
  - Behaves like a turned-on switch and supplies 5V
- A digital pin can be set to produce a logic low output 
  - Behaves like turned-off switch and supplies 0V

<img src="img/LEDProgram.jpg" class="noborder" alt="Variables in C" height="200px"/>

________
#### Blinking LED Example
### Setup the Digital Pin as a Switch

- Tell program to 'setup' an output pin (behave like a switch)
  - Pin 11 can now produce 5V (logic high) or 0V (logic low)
- We could also 'setup' a digital pin to read digital inputs

### Looping while Toggling the Switch

- To blink the LED, flip the digital pin between 5V and 0V every 1s
- 5V is produced by writing a logic high to the digital pin
  - Keep 5V on for 1s by 'delaying' 1s
- 0V is produced by writing a logic low to the digital pin
  - Keep 0V on for 1s by 'delaying' 1s
- Tell program to 'loop' indefinitely through this program

### Storing Inputs in a Variable

- Variables act as memory to store values, similar to math
- There are different variable types 
  - Integer, character, float, string, unsigned int, etc.
- Crucial to define the correct type of variable
  - Variables 'A' and 'B' that hold an integer number can be defined as *int A* and *int B*
  - 'A' can be assigned a value as *A = 2xB* or *A=10*

________    
#### Conditionals
### *IF* and *ELSE* Statements

- *if* and *else* statements can be used to make decisions
- Logic operators compare variables
  - Equal (A==B), not equal (A!=B)
  - Greater than (A>B), Less than (A<B)
  - AND (A&&B), OR (A||B)

<img src="img/if-else.png" class="noborder" alt="setup for switch example" height="150px"/>

________    
#### Conditionals
### Toggle LED with Button Press

- Use an if statement to check if the digital input pin attached to the button is logic-high
- If logic-high, then change state of the LED
  - We need to set a *flag* to make sure LED is not toggled until the next press
  - We don't toggle the LED if the *flag* is high
- Else, reset the *flag* if the button is released
